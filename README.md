numbers
○ Create a method to compute GCD (this will come in handy during operations on
rational)

Add option to work with whole numbers which are also rational numbers i.e. (n/1)
- achieve the above using auxiliary constructors
- enable method overloading to enable each function to work with numbers and rational.
